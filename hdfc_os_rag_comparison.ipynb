For the Optima Suraksha plan, a cumulative bonus is also applicable.\n",

A particularly noteworthy optional cover is \"Overseas Travel Secure,\" which covers travel expenses and accommodation for the insured person and an accompanying person in case of hospitalization abroad, subject to specific conditions (minimum 5-day hospitalization advised by the overseas doctor and a prior accepted claim under the Global Health Cover).  The Overseas Travel Secure benefit reduces the overall sum insured.\n",

Organ donor expenses are also covered.  Note that the Cumulative Bonus is only applicable to the Optima Suraksha plan, not Optima Secure.\n",

Options include emergency air ambulance, daily cash for shared rooms, Protect Benefit, Plus Benefit, Secure Benefit, Automatic Restore Benefit, Aggregate Deductible (various levels available), e-opinion for critical illness, and Global Health Cover (with options for emergency-only or emergency and planned treatments).  Overseas Travel Secure is another optional add-on.  The specific availability and coverage limits for these optional covers are detailed in your policy schedule.

The policy is renewable for life, with a 30-day grace period for annual, semi-annual, and quarterly payments, and a 15-day grace period for monthly payments.  Renewal benefits may include a cumulative bonus (though this is plan-specific), Plus Benefit, and preventive health check-ups.\n",

Submit a completed claim form and required documents within 30 days of discharge.  Additional information requested must be submitted within 15 days.  Contact information is provided in the document.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cancellation:** The policy can be cancelled by HDFC ERGO for reasons such as misrepresentation or non-cooperation. You can also cancel at any time with written notice; however, no premium refund will be given if a claim was made during the policy year.\n",

      "The HDFC ERGO Optima Secure policy is a health insurance plan offering a range of coverage options.  Key features based on the provided documents include:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Coverage:**  The policy covers hospitalization, road ambulance, home healthcare, domiciliary treatment, AYUSH treatment, organ donor expenses, emergency air ambulance, Protect Benefit, Secure Benefit, Plus Benefit, and preventive health check-ups.  It also offers options for Global Health Cover (emergency only or emergency and planned treatments) and Overseas Travel Secure.  Specific coverage details vary depending on the chosen plan (Optima Secure, Optima Secure Global, Optima Secure Global Plus) as shown in Table 34.1.  For example, Secure Benefit is covered at 100% under Optima Secure and Optima Secure Global plans but at 200% under Optima Super.  Global health coverage and Overseas Travel Secure are add-on options, not included in all plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Payment Basis:** Claims are paid on an indemnity basis for most services, meaning you'll be reimbursed for expenses up to your policy limits.  Daily cash for a shared room is paid on a benefit basis (a fixed amount per day).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Loss Sharing:** An aggregate deductible (you choose from 25k/50k/100k/200k/300k) applies to claims during the policy year.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Premium Payment:** You can pay your premium annually, semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Renewal:** The policy is renewable for life.  A grace period applies (30 days for most payment options, 15 days for monthly payments) for late premium payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Exclusions:** The policy excludes expenses for investigations and evaluations primarily for diagnostic purposes, rest cures, rehabilitation, respite care, obesity/weight control surgery (unless specific criteria are met), and gender change treatments.  A full list of exclusions is available in the policy document (Section C.1).  There are also waiting periods for pre-existing conditions (36 months), specific illnesses (24 months), and other illnesses (30 days).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Claims Process:** To file a claim, contact HDFC ERGO 48 hours before planned hospitalization or within 24 hours of emergency hospitalization.  Submit a completed claim form and required documents within 30 days of discharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Add-on Covers:**  The policy offers optional add-ons such as critical illness coverage, hospital cash benefit, personal accident rider, and unlimited restore benefit.  Details are available in the prospectus and policy wording documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Note:** The information above is a summary based on the provided documents.  For complete details, terms, and conditions, please refer to your policy document.  This summary does not constitute legal or financial advice.\n",
